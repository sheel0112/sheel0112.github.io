          <p>
            I got into product to make complex systems feel simple and dependable. Working in sports trading exposed me to
            high-stakes risk decisions, where speed and safety have to coexist. That mindset now guides how I build fintech
            and banking products: clear controls, fast feedback loops, and user journeys that hold up under pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm excited by fintech because it's where trust, regulation, and user experience collide. The opportunity to build
            safer, smarter tools for customers and internal teams — across markets and time zones — is what motivates me to
            keep learning and leading.
