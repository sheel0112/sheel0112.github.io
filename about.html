        <p>
          I’m a product leader working at the intersection of risk, data, and engineering. I specialise in building tools that make complex financial systems feel simple, intuitive, and reliable.
        </p>

        <p>
          My experience spans technical product ownership, quantitative tooling, and cross-department delivery. I work closely with modelling, data engineering, backend services, and frontend teams to ship high-performance systems used in live trading environments.
          I focus on pricing automation, alerting, exposure management, settlement workflows, and operational controls—products that blend real-time data, model outputs, and user-centred design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of my core role, I build side projects combining data, automation, and thoughtful UX—from personal finance apps to an AI meeting assistant. I recently relocated to Bermuda, balancing island life with a continued interest in technology, system design, and creating clarity in complex data environments.
