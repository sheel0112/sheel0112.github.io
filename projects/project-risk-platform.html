      <h1>Digital Risk Platform – Multi-Sport Pricing & Exposure System</h1>
      <p class="project-meta">Lead Product Owner · Angstrom Sports / Entain · 2024–Present</p>

      <div class="pillbox">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          A full modernisation of Angstrom’s risk architecture — unifying pricing, exposure, liquidity, and trader controls
          into a £20m cross-sport platform used across NBA, NFL, and MLB.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        Angstrom operated multiple fragmented tools across sports. Traders lacked consistent controls, visibility, and reliable
        workflows, creating operational bottlenecks during high-pressure events.
      </p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Pricing systems were fast, but risk controls were siloed. Teams needed unified visibility, actionable guardrails, and
        automation to reduce manual workload and improve reaction speed.
      </p>

      <h2>Constraints & Stakes</h2>
      <ul class="list-bullets">
        <li>High-risk, real-money environment where seconds matter</li>
        <li>Cross-team dependencies: FE, BE, modelling, trading, data</li>
        <li>Hard seasonal deadlines (NBA/NFL kick-offs)</li>
        <li>Complex distributed architecture (Kafka streams, microservices)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        As Lead Product Owner for the entire digital risk platform, I owned roadmap definition, cross-sport alignment,
        prototyping, delivery leadership, and stakeholder communication across Entain, BetMGM, and internal teams.
      </p>

      <h2>Actions</h2>
      <ol class="list-steps">
        <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Interviewed 30+ traders to map workflows & pain points.</li>
        <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Designed a unified risk schema across exposure, limits, automation, and pricing impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> Delivered rapid AI-assisted Figma → React prototypes (8 weeks → 2 weeks).</li>
        <li><strong>Team formation:</strong> Built the first cross-functional Risk Product Team.</li>
        <li><strong>KPI Framework:</strong> Defined adoption, latency, exposure accuracy & automation metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Rollout:</strong> Coordinated multi-market onboarding across NBA, NFL & MLB trading teams.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <ul class="list-bullets">
        <li><strong>~40% reduction</strong> in manual workload via workflow simplification.</li>
        <li>8-week UI delivery cycles cut to <strong>2 weeks</strong>.</li>
        <li>Unified risk behaviour across all major US sports.</li>
        <li>Created the foundation for a proprietary feature and future automation pillars.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fintech Relevance</h2>
      <p>
        This project directly maps to financial-services risk management: real-time controls, regulatory alignment, tiered
        permissions, auditability, internal tooling excellence, and operational resilience.
