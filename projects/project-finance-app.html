          Role: Product manager · Focus: smart budgeting, ML-driven categorisation, and low-friction UX.
        </p>

          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Designed a personal finance tool aimed at young adults and couples who struggle to budget.</li>
            <li>Built an experience that prioritises automation over manual spreadsheets.</li>
            <li>Defined data contracts and flows that can scale to live banking integrations.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Context & problem</h2>
        <p>
          Most budgeting tools assume users will manually tag transactions and maintain intricate
          envelopes. In reality, many users want something closer to a “weekly financial pulse”
          that highlights what matters without demanding constant effort.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal for Stacked was to provide clear answers to three questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where is my money actually going?</li>
          <li>What is normal for me vs unusual?</li>
          <li>What one or two actions should I take this month?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Constraints</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed to integrate with open banking APIs (e.g. TrueLayer) with minimal assumptions.</li>
          <li>Limited time from users – interface had to work even if they rarely adjusted settings.</li>
          <li>Needed to be explainable: insights should be traceable back to underlying data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <h3>Understanding behaviours</h3>
        <p>
          I mapped out common money patterns for the target audience: irregular income, shared
          expenses, subscriptions, and end-of-month stress. This informed core flows around
          recurring vs discretionary spend and shared budgeting.
        </p>

        <h3>Shaping the system</h3>
        <p>
          I defined the end-to-end system as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ingestion: connect accounts, pull transactions, normalise merchants.</li>
          <li>Categorisation: rule-based layer plus ML suggestions with confidence scores.</li>
          <li>Insights: monthly and weekly summaries, anomaly flags, and gentle nudges.</li>
          <li>Presentation: responsive web UI with a simple “home” view and deeper drill-downs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Framing delivery</h3>
        <p>
          To keep scope controlled, I shaped an MVP around:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>1–2 connected accounts.</li>
          <li>Core categories (housing, food, transport, subscriptions, other).</li>
          <li>One monthly email / summary view and a lightweight trends dashboard.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A clear product narrative that resonates with users who dislike “traditional budgeting”.</li>
          <li>System design ready to plug into real transaction feeds and extend over time.</li>
          <li>Reusable components for future work on shared accounts and couple-focused features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I’d explore next</h2>
        <p>
          The next stage would be deeper support for shared finances (households / couples) and
          improved explainability of ML decisions – making it obvious why certain transactions were
          flagged or categorised the way they were.
