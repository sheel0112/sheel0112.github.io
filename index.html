          <h2>About</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          I’m a product leader working at the intersection of risk, data, and engineering, with a deep interest in building tools that simplify complexity and strengthen decision-making. My background spans technical product ownership, quantitative tooling, and cross-department delivery across modelling, data engineering, backend services, and frontend platforms. 
          I specialise in turning complex, high-stakes concepts into scalable, intuitive products for real-time operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work focuses on creating high-performance systems for pricing, alerting, exposure management, settlement workflows, and operational controls, products that connect model outputs, live data feeds, and user-focused interfaces.
          I lead multi-disciplinary teams end to end, shaping product vision, structuring roadmaps, translating requirements into actionable work, validating solutions with users, and driving delivery through to production.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a strong passion for risk tooling and for finding practical, efficient ways to remove unnecessary overhead. I enjoy identifying friction in existing processes, reducing manual workload, improving pricing accuracy and speed, and designing tools that enhance visibility, control, and operational performance. 
          My experience includes owning major initiatives involving automation, model-driven recommendations, and real-time monitoring, along with broader programme work that spans multiple product domains. I have also built internal automation including a Python-based testing suite that reduced validation time by more than 60 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I build side projects that combine data, automation, and user-centred design, from financial tracking tools to AI-driven meeting assistants. I have recently relocated to Bermuda, balancing island life with a continued interest in technology, system design, and creating clarity in complex data environments.
          I thrive where product, engineering, and operational expertise come together, and where thoughtful design can transform sophisticated financial systems into simple, reliable, and efficient tools.
